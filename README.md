This is the first project i did during my final year in undergraduate.

We have taken a small dataset of Covid - 19 , just for your understaning purpose . You have to work on the original dataset which contains about 19000 rows .
The data used here is till 29 - April - 2020 and has records as on 29 - April - 2020 .
This data is available as a CSV file , downloaded from Kaggle.

[project 3] : disney + DATASET data analysis project

The project is on the data gathered from the disney+ through kaggle to get the insides of how many series as well as movies was released in the till year 2020 in the platform.

You can see that Disney focuses more on Movies than TV Shows. Maybe because Disney has an audience that prefers movies over TV Shows.

In the Year 2019, Disney+ has added more than 600 movies to their platform. But after that, the graph of movie addition is declined may be due to covid-19 problem. I donâ€™t see a much larger difference in the addition of TV shows to their platform over the years. Maybe because Disney focuses more on Movies than TV Shows.
